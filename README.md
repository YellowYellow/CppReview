# CppReview
a tool to check cpp code's coding standard

I ever developed a tool to check company projects' cpp code's coding standard.
A part of the tool is relevanted to the company's business, because it also can check some logics of game.
So I remove much.

The tool is made by c#,mainly using the Regex to search the point breaking the cpp standard rules.

In the First,I plan to use the method making the compiler.
Obviously it's hard, but there is a example in the github https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck
